  The film is inspired by the true story of Mirco Mencacci, one of the most
  gifted Italian sound editors working today, who happens to be blind. A small
  village in Tuscany, 1971. Mirco is a bright, lively 10-year-old, crazy about
  the movies - especially Westerns and adventure films. His father, an incurable
  idealist, is a truck driver.
